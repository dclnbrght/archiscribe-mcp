# ArchiScribe MCP Server Architecture Overview

The ArchiScribe MCP Server is designed to help AI tools access and use architectural information easily.

## Key Components

- **ArchiScribe MCP Server**  
  The main application that manages and serves architectural data.

- **ArchiMate Model**  
  The source of architectural information, stored in a standard format.

- **MCP Interface**  
  A web-based interface that allows other systems to connect and request information.

- **AI Coding Agent**  
  Tools used by software engineers (such as GitHub Copilot) that interact with the MCP Server to get architectural insights.

## How Components Interact

- The ArchiScribe MCP Server reads the ArchiMate Model.
- The MCP Interface provides a way for AI Coding Agents to communicate with the server.
- AI Coding Agents use the MCP Interface to request and receive information, helping engineers make informed decisions.

This setup allows AI tools to easily access and use architectural data, improving productivity and understanding for software teams.
